Amazon Associate Filter automatically adds your amazon associate id to all Amazon links in your posts and comments. 

== Description ==

Amazon Associate Filter automatically adds your amazon associate id to all Amazon links in your posts and comments. 

It does this AT DISPLAY TIME -- the original link will not be changed in the database. 

This may result in slightly longer render times, but means all existing links will be converted as soon as 
the plugin is activated. 

PLEASE NOTE: You MUST update your Amazon Associate ID in order to properly gain Amazon Associate credits. ALWAYS check that your Amazon Associate ID is correct after activating or updating this plugin. 
If you do not have an Amazon Associates ID, you can get one here: http://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/join

This plugin has not been tested with international Amazon URLs, but has been updated to preserve international TLDs.  

If you experience any bugs, [please alert me to them on my website](http://agaskar.com/post/106141451/wordpress-amazon-associate-filter)
